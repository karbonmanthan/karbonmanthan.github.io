## On Chloris Geospatial's capability to assist with methdology VM0047

Chloris Geospatial claims to have developed a solution that can assist various carbon market players applying the methodology VM0047.

*   **Context -** Environmental markets are witnessing an unprecedented rise in projects related to Nature based solutions across standards. Forests are time-tested banks of carbon capture – and since their performance is this regard is scientifically demonstrable, there has been an increased incentive to develop projects under carbon mechanism.
    
*   **Main potential near-term collaboration – on VM0047 methodology**
    
    *   VERRA’s VM0047 methodology enables such demonstration by providing quantification approaches. This methodology is more advance from those of other standards in two ways
        
        *   This methodology has been faster in adopting the advances in remote sensing – which plays a much larger role in different quantification aspects than for instance the methodology from GS.
            
        *   Adoption of Remote Sensing for dynamic baseline is more advance than GS that relies on static baseline fixed at the starting point and doesn’t undergo major updates during renewal period in practice.
            
    *   As a VVB, SustainCERT has a mandate to verify that the project demonstrate additionality and baseline at each validation and verification. And since for VM0047, testing additionality and baseline involves assessing Performance Benchmark dynamically, solution from Chloris in this regard – stands to bridge the gap for the VVB to be able to test the veracity of impacts being claimed by the project developers. And Chloris’s solution is clear and precise in delivering exactly that remote sensing quantification mentioned in Appendix 1 of the methodology.
        
    *   **Technical points**
        
        *   Stocking indices – a proxy for above ground biomass - derived from remote sensing data is compared with “control points” matching them statistically in order to determine additionality and crediting baseline. Negative slope of stocking indices means a performance benchmark closer to zero ensuring additionality.
            
        *   The requirement is to establish that there is a statistically significant change in biomass of project area compared to control points under baseline conditions.
            
        *   **Chloris’s innovation –** Usually indices like NDFI, NDVI, EVI are used. These are proxies of vegetation health –“greenness” of vegetation derived from subtracting different spectral bands of satellite images of Landsat/Sentinel. Chloris seems to have developed their own index – by fusing data from multiple sensors (multiple satellites) and incorporating LiDAR estimates in training datasets of machine learning models. This index, Chloris claims to be (i) way more stable than standard indices mentioned (NDFI etc.) (ii) way less noisy – because it is not plagued by seasonality and thus leading to an even lower performance benchmark and hence higher demonstrated additionality.
            
    *   While the most crucial aspect of how to adopt Chloris’s technology for a project site would be implemented by the PD, we as a VVB would have to sign off on that implementation after checking during Validation/Verification. Transparency from Chloris’s solution might prove to be beneficial. **Key point for us –** being the capacity of Chloris’s solution to be able to provide the VVBs ability to trace end to end quantification clearly – from selection of donor pool to slope analysis and performance benchmark calculations.
        
*   **Secondary long-term collaboration – on DMRV**
    
    *   SustainCERT has conducted a market study of all the players in the field in order to brainstorm strategies for DMRV in the AFLOU sector.
        
*   Chloris clearly forms part of this pool of a potential technology provider. As the approaches developed by Chloris are clearly headed towards exploiting the possibility of near-real time measurements of even project scenarios (not just baselines). The campaigns runs by Chloris and the technical updates in their products reflect a clear focus on diversifying biomes and geographical locations to which their solutions can be applied – a major technological challenge of DMRV.
    
*   This would require brainstorming workshops to define scopes.
