## On adding new areas to Gold Standard's Forestry LUF Projects

How new areas can be added to Gold Standard's projects for Standalone and PoA project types is not clearly clarified by the Gold Standard on their website or any publication as of 01 October 2025. This post aims to shed some light on this. 


### Speculative reason for the current situation
When PoA requirements were updated by the Gold Standard, they expanded its applicability to LUF projects. Unfortunately, they seem to have not done a pre-emptive mapping of all the consequences for LUF projects - that comply to very different requirements than the renewable or other dominant project types. There is no seperate section for LUF in the PoA Requirements published for instance. Thus, the consequences with regards to rules for LUF can be ascertained only indirectly when one reads [LAND-USE & FORESTS ACTIVITY REQUIREMENTS v.1.2.1](https://globalgoals.goldstandard.org/203-ar-luf-activity-requirements/) in conjunction with [PROGRAMME OF ACTIVITIES (POA) REQUIREMENTS v.2.1](https://globalgoals.goldstandard.org/107-par-programme-of-activity-requirements/). 

The implication is provided below for easy reference to the community. Very briefly, one can state that addition of new areas has similarities with Design Certification process.

### Standalone projects
Adding new areas to Standalone projects post registration (called "New Area Certification" - similar to design certification of new areas)  requires 

- Checking that expansion is not so significant that it cannot be considered under New Area Certification (e.g., effectively creating a new project)

- Site visit 

- Reviewing eligibility conditions - baseline

- Reviewing material changes - changes in baseline emissions, project emissions, leakage and other calculations.

- Reviewing change in project boundaries - shapefile analysis

- Checking safeguarding principles & requirements

- Checking Crediting period end dates, project start dates

- Reviewing expanded Monitoring & Reporting Plan 

- Reviewing sampling approach


### PoA projects
Adding new areas to PoA post registration (through a new regular case VPA or a new real case VPA) requires 

- All the above points from standalone

- Updating PoA boundaries

- Checking PoA Crediting period end dates, PoA start dates and VPA start dates

- Checking new areas fit Inclusion crieteria

- Review Inclusion of VPA related requirements (8.4 of PROGRAMME OF ACTIVITIES (POA) REQUIREMENTS v.2.1 (https://globalgoals.goldstandard.org/107-par-programme-of-activity-requirements/))
