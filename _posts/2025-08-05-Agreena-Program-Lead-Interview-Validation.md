# Program Lead interview

- When did the 1st farmer start activity? 
Agree started onboarding farmers during September 2024.
Actual activities did not begin until September 2024.
1 September was selected based on change in green cover of the fields. Satellite index change selected date based on change.

- Can you provide overview for timelines?
After post intervention data collection, Agreena starts QA/QC - cross check with Remote Sensing and Regional Data.

- Can you describe engagement process?
Farmer facing people that know language and cultural norms. Internally they have customer success team - at least 1 of whom knows the local language. They also have local employed representatives working with Customer Success team. They don't have a representative in every single geographic location. Ongoing farmer consultations and engagements and time specific engagements. They reach out, verify eligibility. Farmers invited onboarding meeting - 1. What are the activities they support under Reg Ag? 2. What are outcomes? 3. What are monitoring obligations? They receive benefit contract. Contact point available for questions. Farmers is onboarded to Agreena-sphere. They then assign the farmers to VERRA or Scope 3 and explain financial aspects. Other stakeholders public, private sphere have had past engagement with dual scope. Carolina - Customer Success Manager will be interviewed that can provide more information.

- How does outreach happen?
Main outreach is proactively is done by Agreena. For Poland they did market research to find out that social media is best way for farmer reach out. Have email address for contact and contact info box from farmers directly from the website. Or by word of mouth. 

- How is eligibility checked?
Initial checks - Remote sensing check for clearing in last 10 years, that they have not encroached on pristine lands, no overlaps of fields to avoid under/over estimation. Causality is checked - checking current mandates. Check their capacities for transitioning to new activities.  

- Are there any govt collaboration or outside partnerships?
Danish embassy with local market players supported them with collaborations. 

- If the benefits contract the final contract farmer will receive?
Terms and Conditions document as an additional document has not been sent yet.

- IDD Section 6.1. says all farmers will be compensated. How will payments be provided and who provides them?
Determined by final emissions reductions and removals. The extent to which new practice is implemented. In a typical system 15% value of credits is retained within VERRA and 10% retained for "Premium pool" to be paid for consistently sticking with activities. Payment is after sale. 

- How do farmers contact them?
Local representative's email is provided. Call center and chat support is provided for general issues. Grievance mechanism is in place. 

- Does Agreena provided technical training for implementation?
No. Training or Agronomic advice is not provided.

- How are agronomic issues resolved?
Project related questions are resolved through channels mentioned. Program team has some experts that can provide some answers but not agronomic advice.

- What material is provided to farmer to help them understand monitoring obligation?
During Onboarding, Agreena explains - baseline settings and other details. Further meeting is organized for Baseline setting.

- Are there any plans to ensure long term collaboration with farmers?
They do not have long term SOP for engagement, they rely on just proactive engagement and high satisfaction. They do not want to burden them. Their marketing events makes them feel like part of the network. They appear only twice a year for data but they feel like they are leading the space. 

- If the farmer exits program what is the process of recording it?
They have a system in place if farmers decides to drop off. Its a requirement for VERRA also. The monitoring process continues along with Remote sensing analysis.

- Have you rejected any farmers for the reason that they had already been mandated for Reg Ag? 
No farmer has ever been rejected for mandated activities. Initial onboarding check for farmers they checked for common practice - like if the farmer already did reduced tillage.

## Monitoring Related questions

- How is baseline data is collected?
5 year look back period. During baseline collection, they request information via template spreadsheet. Encourage them to provide as much primary data as possible - yield, practices of tillage, cover cropping, residue management, fertilizer, fuel use. They might not be able to provide all data, then Agreena replaces it with remote sensing data or secondary data in a conservative way. 

- How about cases where secondary data diverged a lot from primary input from farmers?
They employ conservative approach but another employee can be interviewed for answering this questions.

## Deviation questions

- Approval obtained on 3 deviation. Can you confirm that is the case?
VM0042 v.2.0. is used. Draft version of v.2.1. did not include liming parameters. When 2.1. was published liming parameter was included. They connected with VERRA, they used regional data since the farmers were already onboarded. Requested to send approval related documentation.

- Initial SOC is also under deviation request but in IDD Section 4.5. SOC changes are modeled with SOC which is contradictory. Can you explain?
Measured values are not available across all fields. They initialized with stratification of measured values along with Soil Grid. Soil Grid has been accepted via IME with VERRA. Marcos to provide more information on this. 

## Yield questions

- How is data related to estimated yield productivity provided?
2023 onboarding and QA/QC check data was provided as an estimate. We will issue findings in Round 1 regarding this.


- How did you engage remote sensing?
Remote sensing is in-house with Data Science team. They are trained internally. Ground truthing campaign is carried out - details in IDD. Accuracy to be provided.
