# SC ACADEMY – GHG AUDITOR TRAINING  
**Date:** 19 AUG 2025  
**Session:** 2022, 4 JULY  

---

## General GHG Knowledge  
**Literature base:** ISO  

- **ISO 14064** – 1/2/3 → GHG statement requirement for auditors  
- **ISO 17065** – accreditation  

---

## Activity Data  
Measure of activity that results in ERs.  
Amount of energy etc.  
Part of Monitoring Plan.  
& Emission Factor  

---

## Emission Factor  
Transform monitoring parameters to baseline, project or leakage emissions.  

---

## Model  
- Can I ask for control points for model analysis if they insist on using model alone?  

---

## GWP  
Transforms everything to CO₂e.  
Measure of radiative forcing of pulse emission of unit mass of GHG over present-day atmosphere relative to unit mass of CO₂.  
It can be computed over different time horizons – 20, 100, 500 years because some gases are short lived (CH₄), some long lived (N₂O – 100 years).  

- **GWP-20** CH₄ = 81 → 1 ton CH₄ = 81 tCO₂e over 20 years  
- **GWP-100** CH₄ = 27 → 1 ton CH₄ = 27 tCO₂e over 100 years  

**Notes:**  
- Emphasis on persistent gas  
- Emphasis on rapid climate forcers  
- Accounts for decay in time  

Choosing GWP-20, GWP-100 can shift policy priorities (decarbonization vs. methane mitigation).  
**IPCC uses GWP-100.**  

---

### CH₄ life  
- 12 years atm. time means average time CH₄ molecule remains in atm before being destroyed.  
- CH₄ decays exponentially.  

- After 12 years → 37% remains  
- 24 years → 13.5%  
- 36 years → 5%  

---

## Materiality  
Needed in practice when carbon is reported.  
How misstatement can affect decisions taken by stakeholders.  
Threshold depends on activity and standard.  
Can be qualitative, quantitative.  

- **Qualitative materiality** assessed at Validation.  
- Even non-material errors need to be corrected.  

---

## Key Principles  
- **Relevance** – appropriate data and methodology  
- **Completeness** – include all pools  
- **Consistency** – meaningful comparison  
- **Accuracy** – reduce bias uncertainty  
- **Transparency** – disclose sufficient info  
- **Conservativeness** – no overestimation  

---

## ANSI  
- **Scope 3** – Landuse and Forestry  
- **Scope 1** – GHG ER from fuel combustion  
  - RE replacing fuel combustion  
  - Community service projects replacing fuel combustion (e.g., cookstoves)

# Principles of Auditing (5 JULY 2022)  

## ISO 17064 Principles  
- Impartiality – no bias on client  
- Evidence based approach – any conclusion is backed by evidence  
- Fair presentation – truthful, report obstacles, diverging opinions  
- Documentation – document everything  
- Conservativeness – cautiously moderate values, no overestimation  

**COI** – Auditor has any interaction with project in last 4 years.  

---

## ISO 17066 Personal Skills and Attributes  
- Independence

- Evidence based approach  

---

## ISO 21066 Behaviour  
- Ethical  
- Open minded  
- Diplomatic  
- Observant  
- Perceptive  
- Adaptable  
- Tenacious  
- Decisive  
- Self reliant  
- Acting with fortitude  
- Organized

# Audit Process (ISO 14064-9 PROCESS 209)  

## Contract  
- Pre engagement activities  
  - Define scope of work  
  - Selection of audit team  

## Validation/Verification Planning  
- Document review  
- Risk assessment  
- Evidence gathering plan  
- Validation/Verification Plan  

## Validation/Verification Execution  
- Perform audit  
- Create findings list  
- Perform independent review  

## Completion of Validation/Verification  
- Assess response to findings  
- Assess changes on documents  
- Prepare Validation/Verification Report  

---

## Independent Review  
Issuance of opinion → Final approval and signature of report.  

---

# ISO 19012: 2018 On Site Audit Process  

## Conducting Opening Meeting  
- Explain audit plan, scope, criteria and timeline  
- Introduce audit team and other participants as relevant  
- Formal communication channels including language  
- Confidentiality issues  
- Conditions under which audit may be terminated  

## Communicating During Audit  
- Assure clarity on progress  
- Evidence that suggest significant risks  
- Action needed (e.g., change in audit plan) – to be approved by client  

Audit finding to indicate conformity / non conformity with Audit criteria.  

---

## Determining Audit Conclusions  
- Prepare closing meeting  
  - Review finding within team  
  - Content of audit conclusions  
  - Extent of conformity, achievement of audit objectives  

- Conduct closing meeting  
  - Advise auditee about evidence collected on sample  
  - Present results & findings  
  - Brief Post Audit activities  

---

# Remote Audit  
- Time and software clarified & tested upfront  
- Define participants  
- Clear audit plan  
- Clarify before recording audit  

---

# Audit Technique  
- Observation  
- Inquiry  
- Analytical testing  
- Confirmation  
- Examination  
- Recalculations  
- Tracing / Retracing  
- Control Testing  
- Estimate Testing  
- Sampling  
- Cross checking  
- Reconciliation  

---

# Additionality  
Uncertainty – value characterising dispersion of result  
Level of assurance – degree of confidence in GHG Statement (Reasonable or limited → an audit usually)  

- **Step 0:** Demonstrate Project Activity is first-of-its-kind (TOOL 29)  
- **Step 1:** Identification of alternatives to project activity  
- **Step 2:** Investment Analysis (TOOL 27)  
- **Step 3:** Barrier Analysis  
- **Step 4:** Common practice analysis (TOOL 27)  

---

# Verification  
Evaluate claim is materially correct and conforms to criteria.
