## On difference between Value Chain and Voluntary Carbon Markets

Don't let them fool you. The Value Chain space is just Voluntary Carbon Markets dressed over with slightly different technical gobbeldegook. Under the hood, they operate on the same principle. Both involve a change a technology or practice leading to either emissions reductions or emissions removals that can be traded between different actors. This core idea has its roots in the framework EPA came up with following Clean Air Act amendments that underpins the [history of the Carbon Markets](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/carbon-offsets-2023/timeline.html). Just as the a ton of CO<sub>2</sub> reduced or stored is commodified into a product called "carbon credits" which is traded for profit between different entities in the Voluntary Carbon Markets, in the same way a ton of CO<sub>2</sub> is commodified into the "impact units" product that can be sold within companies of same Value Chains in different layers to make profit. Profit being the most critical incentive that moves players in both space to make any change towards sustainable growth regardless of how honest they are about it.

With this same underpinning principle, there are some non-trivial  differences. Some are artificially created, others are inherent.

### Boundaries

They both define slightly different boundaries. While the Value Chain draws its boundaries on chain of activities transforming value of some raw material (say cacoa to chocolate), the Voluntary Carbon Market often draws physical boundaries (like boundaries of a forest plantation, or village boundaries where cookstoves are distributed).

### Nature of emissions

They both differ slightly in nature of their emissions. While the Value Chain space concerns itself with "Scope 3" emissions reductions/removals - "indirect" (claiming lack of complete control - see [[1]](#1)) greenhouse gas emissions occurring through a company's chain , the Voluntary Carbon Markets concerns itself with greenhouse gas emissions reductions/removals associated with well defined activities within the physical boundaries they control or influence.

### Players in the game

They both involve companies of different weights. While Value Chain space is dominated by heavyweights - large multinational cooperates along with many subsidiary companies within a value chain co-claiming without double counting, the Voluntary Carbon Markets is a space usually occupied by featherweight - smaller NGOs and carbon consultants claiming without double counting.

### Money

People who position themselves advantageously in the market - Standards, VVBs, consultants - cash in on that last difference mentioned above. Value Chain Corporates heavyweights can pay. They have made bold net-zero claims to be achieved without knowing how. But they have money. And so the market - taking advantage of their position, a general lack of standardization of rules and using [technical jibberish](https://karbonmanthan.github.io/2025/06/23/On-Carbon-Market-jargon.html) to give an air of difference with Voluntary Carbon Markets charges these corporates more than 10 times what they would charge the smaller players of Voluntary Carbon Markets that struggle to pay through thier nose.

---

### Standardization 

Value chain has not been able to yet create as much standard rules and requirements in the same way as the Voluntary Carbon Markets has. This happens to be quiet convenient to the market (see the point above).

---

Perhaps the most damning of all proof that Voluntary Carbon Markets is same as Value Chain is that in the organization I work in, there is not even a different team for these two spaces. The same set of auditors who audit Voluntary Carbon Markets are also the one who audit Value Chain Interventions! We just charge Value Chain players way more. Environmental Markets gives better repeat business. But Value Chain space is still picking up and it brings in much larger revenue pie.

<a id="1">[1]</a> Companies conveniently call them "indirect" emissions claiming a lack of control as it involves other actors over which they might not have operational control.
