# On Double Claiming and Double Counting loopholes in the carbon market

Project developers have the freedom to define what constitutes a project in the carbon market. This allows them to break up a big project into smaller multiple projects that they can submit to different carbon schemes and essentially diversify their revenue stream provided they are able to segregate the end user beneficiaries and have distinct geographical boundaries. 

For instance, Agreena has registered a regenerative agriculture project under VERRA standard in the environmental markets. In the same country, they are running another regenerative agricultural project under SustainCERT's Scope 3 - using the same methodology albeit with a different set of farmers over different set of farms than the VERRA project. Neither the farms nor the farmers for VERRA overlap with those of SustainCERT's Scope 3 participants. But they do benefits from lower cost as they get to club Consultation activities, farmers outreach and data collection process for both projects. They also benefit from diversifying the revenue stream and making their project less risky. There is a potential that such practice can undercut the additionality and causality claim.

Upenergy has similarly conducted a cookstove project under VERRA and GS where they have ensured that end users are different even when the general project location is the same and both use the same methodology. 

Since there is no rule against it, such practices goes unchecked.

## Obligation as a VVB

Seeing that there is a lack of safeguard for this behavior - what can the VVBs do to ensure that no rules are broken and protect their liability?

- **Seek declaration** - always raise a finding in such a case to obtain an official signed declaration of no double claiming and no double counting from the project developer. In case the credits are cancelled in the future owing to double counting issues, the declaration can protect the VVB that can only check the project at a specific instance under a specific mandays. The VVB shall include such a declaration in their reporting.

- **Search text strings** - perform a text based search of similar strings across the different standards to ensure crediting is not being issued on same participants.

- **Interview stakeholders** - rigorously ask the participants regarding the scheme they think they are under and cross examine them to ensure that there are not involved in multiple schemes.

- **FAR for future Verification** - raise a Forward Action Request (FAR) for future verification site visit where the participants from both project locations can be interviewed. 

- **No prior rejection** - ensure that the project is not trying to include areas or participants that have been formerly rejected under a different standard. This might be a way for them to generate credits out of participants that have been rejected under another scheme.
