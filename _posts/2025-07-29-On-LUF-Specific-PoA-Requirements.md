While the Requirements allow LUF projects the actual language restricts the wording to just Forestry/AGR – so it can be assumed that SOC or blue carbon projects do not fall under the purview of PoA projects. 

From {PROGRAMME OF ACTIVITIES (POA) REQUIREMENTS v.2.1} {https://globalgoals.goldstandard.org/107-par-programme-of-activity-requirements/} here are some AGR/Forestry specific requirements: 

Real case VPAs must describe every conditions for regular case VPAs to follow in advance.
