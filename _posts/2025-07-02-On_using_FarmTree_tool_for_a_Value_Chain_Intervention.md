## On using FarmTree tool for a Value Chain Intervention Validation

Don't let them fool you. The Value Chain space is just Environmental Markets clothed over with slightly different technical gobbeldegook. Under the hood, they operate on the same principle. Both involve a change a technology or practice leading to either emissions reductions or emissions removals that can be traded between different actors. This core idea has its roots in the framework EPA came up with following Clean Air Act amendments underpins the [history of the Carbon Markets](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/carbon-offsets-2023/timeline.html). Just as the a ton of CO2 reduced or stored is commidified into a product called "carbon credits" which is traded for profit between different entities in the Environmental Markets, in the same way a ton of CO2 is commodified into the "impact units" products that can be sold within companies of same Value Chains in different layers to make profit. Profit being the most critical incentive that moves players in both space to make the change regardless of how honest they are about it.


With this same underpinning principle, there are some non-trivial  differences. 

**Boundaries** - They both define slightly different boundaries. While the Value Chain draws its boundaries on chain of activities transforming value of some raw material (say cacoa to chocolate), the Environmental market often draws physical boundaries (like boundaries of a forest plantation). 

**Nature of emissions** - They both differ slightly in nature of their emissions. While the Value Chain space concerns itself with "Scope 3" emissions reductions/removals - "indirect" (claiming lack of complete control - see [[1]](#1)) greenhouse gas emissions occurring through a company's chain , the Environmental markets concerns itself with greenhouse gas emissions reductions/removals associated with well defined activities within the physical boundaries they control or influence. 

**Players in the game** - They both involve companies of different weights. While Value Chain space is dominated by large multinational cooperates along with many subsidiary companies within a value chain co-claiming without double counting, the Environmental Markets is a space usually occupied by smaller NGOs and carbon consultants claiming without double counting. 

**Money** - Market cashes in on that last difference. Value Chain Corporates heavyweights can pay. They have made bold net-zero claims to be achieved without know how. But they have money. And so the market - taking advantange of their knowledge, a general lack of standardization of rules and using [technical jibberish](https://karbonmanthan.github.io/2025/06/23/On-Carbon-Market-jargon.html) to give an air of difference with Environmental markets charges these corporates more than 10 times what they would charge the smaller players of Environmental Markets that struggle to pay through thier nose.

**Standardization** - Value chain has not been able to yet create as much standard rules and requirements in the same way as the Environmental Markets has. This happens to be quiet convienient to the market (see the point above).


Coming from EM side, VC's fees are mindblowing to me. We would get max USD 6k for Certifying a combined Validation Verification together, agreena is USD 127k! I would have to work 4-6 months of earning revenue from several projects for that type of amount.

### Has farmtree tool ever been used for carbon credits? 
Not really. There is some pilot project related connection for Acorn. Moreover, Acron's methodology uses models for remote sensing quantification expost.

### What does the meth ask?
ex post - Measurements -> allometric equations to convert tree dimension measurement to biomass (fixed area) or to convert basal area/ha to biomass (variable area).

ex ante - Model of past growth can be used. Or allometric equations to be used as set out in Appendix 1. 

### What did registered projects use?
4137 - ex ante Chapmans Richard equation; ex post - measurements


### How did Forever Chocolate get revalidated? What modelling was used?
Census based approach to monitor mortality but not a full biomass inventory. But PD's argument that it was too difficult was accepted.

Let's just ask them to do it. And if really push comes to shove, we could propose these other alternatives.

**Option 1**
One option is that we could allow them deviation saying - you gotta conduct a small biomass inventory study once to show that your current quantification approach is conservative and consistent. It seems that this was done for forever chocolate.

**Option 2**
Another option - if we really cannot enforce measurement - is to ask for a written statement from an expert - forever chocoloate did this as well they got an expert from south pole to sign off on it. This might take even less time.

### What does the model offer? 

### What is the finding with clause?

Change in the carbon stocks in the project references the use of AR-TOOL 14.

	The tool explicitly states that the use of model for estimation of tress biomass is exlusively restricted to the ex-ante estimation.

	Section 8.2. AR-TOOL14 lays out the modelling approach for this ex ante estimation - stating that the tree growth is simulated using local tree-growth data from past experience.

	The Intervention Developer has submitted the FarmTree tool as a way to quantify the biomass. The model tool seems to be modelling tree growth as a function of radiative forcing, production potential and contraining factors that determine that potential. Such a tool/ modelling approach hasn't really been used in the carbon market before for biomass estimation and issuance of credits. Standard practice is to use growth curve approach or allometric equation.

	Based on this the following CAR is raised 

	** CAR 1 ** - The Intervention Developer shall demonstrate how their ex ante model adopted is in compliance with clauses in Sections 1, 8.2 and Appendix 1 of AR-TOOL14 quoted above. From the model booklet submitted it is not exactly clear to the reviewer how these conditions are satisfied for ex ante model.

*	ex post

	The tool explicitly states that ex post estimation of tree biomass uses data from measurements conducted in sample plot.

	Approach of ex post estimates using measurements and allometric equation to determine stock change is consistent with almost all the standard methodologies in the market. It is a standard practice to conduct these measurements using sampling approach so as to make it feasible over a larger area across several actors at a certain precision level.

	Appendix 1 of AR-TOOL14 sets out methods to measure plot biomass.

	Based on this the following CAR is raised

	** CAR 2 ** - The Intervention Developer shall demonstrate how their ex post approach complies with the requirement direct measurements for biomass estimation following Appendix 1 of the AR-TOOL14.
