## On using FarmTree tool for a Value Chain Intervention Validation

### Has farmtree tool ever been used for carbon credits? 
Not really. There is some pilot project related connection for Acorn. Moreover, Acron's methodology uses models for remote sensing quantification expost.

### What does the meth ask?
ex post - Measurements -> allometric equations to convert tree dimension measurement to biomass (fixed area) or to convert basal area/ha to biomass (variable area).

ex ante - Model of past growth can be used. Or allometric equations to be used as set out in Appendix 1. 

### What did registered projects use?
4137 - ex ante Chapmans Richard equation; ex post - measurements


### How did Forever Chocolate get revalidated? What modelling was used?
Census based approach to monitor mortality but not a full biomass inventory. But PD's argument that it was too difficult was accepted.

Let's just ask them to do it. And if really push comes to shove, we could propose these other alternatives.

**Option 1**
One option is that we could allow them deviation saying - you gotta conduct a small biomass inventory study once to show that your current quantification approach is conservative and consistent. It seems that this was done for forever chocolate.

**Option 2**
Another option - if we really cannot enforce measurement - is to ask for a written statement from an expert - forever chocoloate did this as well they got an expert from south pole to sign off on it. This might take even less time.

### What does the model offer? 

### What is the finding with clause?

Change in the carbon stocks in the project references the use of AR-TOOL 14. 

Clause 20 Section 5.5 AR-AMS0007 -

*	ex ante

	The tool explicitly states that the use of model for estimation of tress biomass is exlusively restricted to the ex-ante estimation.

Clause 1 Section 1 AR-TOOL14
	<img src="https://github.com/karbonmanthan/karbonmanthan.github.io/blob/de6881b4003a2d661912ddbff8478b1635cf8d57/assets/exante.png?raw=true" alt="Clause 1 Section 1 AR-TOOL14">

	Section 8.2. AR-TOOL14 lays out the modelling approach for this ex ante estimation - stating that the tree growth is simulated using local tree-growth data from past experience. 

Section 8.2 AR-TOOL14

	The Intervention Developer has submitted the FarmTree tool as a way to quantify the biomass. The model tool seems to be modelling tree growth as a function of radiative forcing, production potential and contraining factors that determine that potential. Such a tool/ modelling approach hasn't really been used in the carbon market before for biomass estimation and issuance of credits. Standard practice is to use growth curve approach or allometric equation.

Clause 6 Section 1 Appendix 1 AR-TOOL14
 <img src="https://github.com/karbonmanthan/karbonmanthan.github.io/blob/de6881b4003a2d661912ddbff8478b1635cf8d57/assets/exanteapproach.png?raw=true" alt="Clause 6 Section 1 Appendix 1 AR-TOOL14">

	Based on this the following CAR is raised 

	** CAR 1 ** - The Intervention Developer shall demonstrate how their ex ante model adopted is in compliance with clauses in Sections 1, 8.2 and Appendix 1 of AR-TOOL14 quoted above. From the model booklet submitted it is not exactly clear to the reviewer how these conditions are satisfied for ex ante model.

*	ex post

	The tool explicitly states that ex post estimation of tree biomass uses data from measurements conducted in sample plot. 

	Clause 1 Section 1 AR-TOOL14
	<img src="https://github.com/karbonmanthan/karbonmanthan.github.io/blob/de6881b4003a2d661912ddbff8478b1635cf8d57/assets/exante.png?raw=true" alt="Clause 1 Section 1 AR-TOOL14">

	Approach of ex post estimates using measurements and allometric equation to determine stock change is consistent with almost all the standard methodologies in the market. It is a standard practice to conduct these measurements using sampling approach so as to make it feasible over a larger area across several actors at a certain precision level.

	Appendix 1 of AR-TOOL14 sets out methods to measure plot biomass.

	Based on this the following CAR is raised

	** CAR 2 ** - The Intervention Developer shall demonstrate how their ex post approach complies with the requirement direct measurements for biomass estimation following Appendix 1 of the AR-TOOL14.
